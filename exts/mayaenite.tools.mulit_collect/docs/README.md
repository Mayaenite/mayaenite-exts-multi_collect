***Know Problems***.

* `Usdz Issues` *When Generating Usdz files things to take note.*\
***custom mdl's***\
if your collected assets contain custom mdl's\
When omniverse loads in the usdz file the items assined to mdl's will show up as red\
omniverse will say somthing about a syntax error not sure why.\
I do not beleive this is a usdz error because if you unzip the file it loads fine
